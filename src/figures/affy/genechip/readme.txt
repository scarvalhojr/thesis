Added a 1-pixel border around the BMP files then used Photoshop to convert from BMP to EPS as follows:
- Chicken array: 345 pixels/inch resolution, preserving the 986x986 dimension to produce an image of size 2.858 x 2.858 inches (7.26 x 7.26 cm)
- Human HGU92A array: 225 pixels/inch resolution, preserving the 642x642 dimension to produce an image of size 2.853 x 2.853 inches (7.25 x 7.25 cm)
