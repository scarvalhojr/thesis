  abstract = {The quadratic assignment problem (QAP) is a classical combinatorial
	optimization problem with numerous applications in facility location,
	scheduling, manufacturing, VLSI design, statistical data analysis,
	etc. The QAP is an extremely hard problem from both theoretical
	and practical points of view: 1) The QAP is NP-hard to solve to
	optimality and to approximate within a constant approximation ratio,
	and 2) QAP instances of size larger than 22 are still considered
	intractable. Hence, the QAP is in effect a problem that has yet
	to be solved. This volume presents a general overview of the most
	studied aspects of the QAP, as well as outlining a number of research
	directions which currently seem to be promising. The book gives
	a systematic presentation of various results scattered in the literature,
	such as: bounding techniques and exact solution methods, linearisations,
	heuristic approaches and computational complexity. Some more recent
	research directions discussed in detail in the book are the asymptotic
	behaviour of the QAP and restricted versions of the problem: in
	particular, polynomially solvable and provably hard cases of the
	QAP. Audience: This volume will be of interest to researchers and
	students interested in the quadratic assignment problem and to practitioners
	who face the QAP and wish to better understand this problem in its
	inherent complexity.},

  abstract = {Gene expression analysis by means of microarrays is based on the sequence-specific
	binding of RNA to DNA oligonucleotide probes and its measurement
	using fluorescent labels. The binding of RNA fragments involving
	sequences other than the intended target is problematic because
	it adds a chemical background to the signal, which is not related
	to the expression degree of the target gene. The article presents
	a molecular signature of specific and nonspecific hybridization
	with potential consequences for gene expression analysis. We analyzed
	the signal intensities of perfect match (PM) and mismatch (MM) probes
	of GeneChip microarrays to specify the effect of specific and nonspecific
	hybridization. We found that these events give rise to different
	relations between the PM and MM intensities as function of the middle
	base of the PM, namely a triplet-like (C > G approximately T > A
	> 0) and a duplet-like (C approximately T > 0 > G approximately
	A) pattern of the PM-MM log-intensity difference upon binding of
	specific and nonspecific RNA fragments, respectively. The systematic
	behavior of the intensity difference can be rationalized on the
	level of basepairings of DNA/RNA oligonucleotide duplexes in the
	middle of the probe sequence. Nonspecific binding is characterized
	by the reversal of the central Watson-Crick (WC) pairing for each
	PM/MM probe pair, whereas specific binding refers to the combination
	of a WC and a self-complementary (SC) pairing in PM and MM probes,
	respectively. The Gibbs free energy contribution of WC pairs to
	duplex stability is asymmetric for purines and pyrimidines of the
	PM and decreases according to C > G approximately T > A. SC pairings
	on the average only weakly contribute to duplex stability. The intensity
	of complementary MM introduces a systematic source of variation
	which decreases the precision of expression measures based on the
	MM intensities.},

	dual procedure (DP) similar to the Hungarian method for solving
	the linear assignment problem. Our DP solves the QAP in certain
	cases, i.e., for some small problems (N < 7) and for numerous larger
	problems (7 =< N =< 16) that arise as sub-problems of a larger QAP
	such as the Nugent 20. The DP, however, does not guarantee a solution.
	It is used in our algorithm to calculate lower bounds on solutions

	the DP produces lower bounds that are as tight as any which might
	be useful in a branch-and-bound algorithm. These are produced relatively
	cheaply, especially on larger problems. Experimental results show
	that the computational complexity of our algorithm is lower than

  abstract = {Motivation: During microarray production, several thousands of oligonucleotides
	(short DNA sequences) are synthesized in parallel, one nucleotide
	at a time. We are interested in finding the shortest possible nucleotide
	deposition sequence to synthesize all oligos in order to reduce
	production time and increase oligo quality. Thus we study the shortest
	common supersequence problem of several thousand short strings over
	a four-letter alphabet. Results: We present a statistical analysis
	of the basic ALPHABET-LEFTMOSTapproximation algorithm, and propose
	several practical heuristics to reduce the length of the supersequence.
	Our results show that it is hard to beat ALPHABET-LEFTMOSTin the
	microarray production setting by more than 2 characters, but these
	savings can improve overall oligo quality by more than four percent.

  abstract = {Oligonucleotide microarrays, also called "DNA chips," are currently
	made by a light-directed chemistry that requires a large number
	of photolithographic masks for each chip. Here we describe a maskless
	array synthesizer (MAS) that replaces the chrome masks with virtual
	masks generated on a computer, which are relayed to a digital micromirror
	array. A 1:1 reflective imaging system forms an ultraviolet image
	of the virtual mask on the active surface of the glass substrate,
	which is mounted in a flow cell reaction chamber connected to a
	DNA synthesizer. Programmed chemical coupling cycles follow light
	exposure, and these steps are repeated with different virtual masks
	to grow desired oligonucleotides in a selected pattern. This instrument
	has been used to synthesize oligonucleotide microarrays containing
	more than 76,000 features measuring 16 microm 2. The oligonucleotides
	were synthesized at high repetitive yield and, after hybridization,
	could readily discriminate single-base pair mismatches. The MAS
	is adaptable to the fabrication of DNA chips containing probes for
	thousands of genes, as well as any other solid-phase combinatorial
	chemistry to be performed in high-density microarrays.},
