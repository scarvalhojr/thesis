  pages = {304},
  abstract = {The quadratic assignment problem (QAP) is a classical combinatorial
	optimization problem with numerous applications in facility location,
	scheduling, manufacturing, VLSI design, statistical data analysis,
	etc. The QAP is an extremely hard problem from both theoretical
	and practical points of view: 1) The QAP is NP-hard to solve to
	optimality and to approximate within a constant approximation ratio,
	and 2) QAP instances of size larger than 22 are still considered
	intractable. Hence, the QAP is in effect a problem that has yet
	to be solved. This volume presents a general overview of the most
	studied aspects of the QAP, as well as outlining a number of research
	directions which currently seem to be promising. The book gives
	a systematic presentation of various results scattered in the literature,
	such as: bounding techniques and exact solution methods, linearisations,
	heuristic approaches and computational complexity. Some more recent
	research directions discussed in detail in the book are the asymptotic
	behaviour of the QAP and restricted versions of the problem: in
	particular, polynomially solvable and provably hard cases of the
	QAP. Audience: This volume will be of interest to researchers and
	students interested in the quadratic assignment problem and to practitioners
	who face the QAP and wish to better understand this problem in its
	inherent complexity.},

	has attracted increasing number of biologists, bioengineers and

	the whole genome at once, so that researchers can study the whole
	genome on the global level and have a better picture of the expressions
	among millions of genes simultaneously. Today, it is widely used
	in many fields - disease diagnosis, gene classification, gene regulatory
	network, and drug discovery. We present a concatenated software
	solution for the entire DNA array flow exploring all steps of a
	consolidated software tool. The proposed software tool has been
	tested on Herpes B virus as well as simulated data. Our experiments
	show that the genomic data follow the pattern predicted by simulated
	data although the number of border conflicts (quality of the DNA
	array design) is several times smaller than for simulated data.
	We also report a trade-off between the number of border conflicts
	and the running time for several proposed algorithmic techniques
	employed in the physical design of DNA arrays.},

	of 1:100 000. Detection is quantitative over more than two orders

  volume = {89},
  pages = {337--352},
  number = {1},

  abstract = {Gene expression analysis by means of microarrays is based on the sequence-specific
	binding of RNA to DNA oligonucleotide probes and its measurement
	using fluorescent labels. The binding of RNA fragments involving
	sequences other than the intended target is problematic because
	it adds a chemical background to the signal, which is not related
	to the expression degree of the target gene. The article presents
	a molecular signature of specific and nonspecific hybridization
	with potential consequences for gene expression analysis. We analyzed
	the signal intensities of perfect match (PM) and mismatch (MM) probes
	of GeneChip microarrays to specify the effect of specific and nonspecific
	hybridization. We found that these events give rise to different
	relations between the PM and MM intensities as function of the middle
	base of the PM, namely a triplet-like (C > G approximately T > A
	> 0) and a duplet-like (C approximately T > 0 > G approximately
	A) pattern of the PM-MM log-intensity difference upon binding of
	specific and nonspecific RNA fragments, respectively. The systematic
	behavior of the intensity difference can be rationalized on the
	level of basepairings of DNA/RNA oligonucleotide duplexes in the
	middle of the probe sequence. Nonspecific binding is characterized
	by the reversal of the central Watson-Crick (WC) pairing for each
	PM/MM probe pair, whereas specific binding refers to the combination
	of a WC and a self-complementary (SC) pairing in PM and MM probes,
	respectively. The Gibbs free energy contribution of WC pairs to
	duplex stability is asymmetric for purines and pyrimidines of the
	PM and decreases according to C > G approximately T > A. SC pairings
	on the average only weakly contribute to duplex stability. The intensity
	of complementary MM introduces a systematic source of variation
	which decreases the precision of expression measures based on the
	MM intensities.},

	and estimate their hybridization properties. Oligos designed by
	Picky are computationally optimized to guarantee the best specificity,
	sensitivity and uniformity under the given design constrains. Picky
	can be used to design arrays for whole genomes, or for only a subset
	of genes. The latter can still be screened against a whole genome
	to attain the same quality as a whole genome array, thereby permitting
	low budget, pathway-specific experiments to be conducted with large

	It is used in our algorithm to calculate lower bounds on solutions

	the DP produces lower bounds that are as tight as any which might
	be useful in a branch-and-bound algorithm. These are produced relatively

	We benchmarked 31 probe set algorithms using a U95A dataset of spike

	performance. In particular, background correction appears to improve

	put this balance in perspective. Furthermore, we have improved some

	biological agents present in some given sample, e.g. to identify
	viruses causing disease, for quality control in the food industry,
	or to determine bacteria contaminating drinking water. The selection
	of specific oligos to attach to the array surface is a relevant
	problem in the experiment design process. Given a set S of genomic
	sequences (the target sequences), the task is to find at least one
	oligonucleotide, called probe, for each sequence in S. This probe
	will be attached to the array surface, and must be chosen in a way
	that it will not hybridize to any other sequence but the intended
	target. Furthermore, all probes on the array must hybridize to their
	intended targets under the same reaction conditions, most importantly
	at the temperature T at which the experiment is conducted. RESULTS:
	We present an efficient algorithm for the probe design problem.
	Melting temperatures are calculated for all possible probe-target
	interactions using an extended nearest-neighbor model, allowing
	for both non-Watson-Crick base-pairing and unpaired bases within
	a duplex. To compute temperatures efficiently, a combination of
	suffix trees and dynamic programming based alignment algorithms
	is introduced. Additional filtering steps during preprocessing increase
	the speed of the computation. The practicability of the algorithms

  abstract = {DNA probe arrays have emerged as a core genomic technology thatenables
	cost-effective gene expression monitoring, mutation detection,single
	nucleotide polymorphism analysis and other genomicanalyses. DNA
	chips are manufactured through a highly scalableprocess, Very Large-Scale
	Immobilized Polymer Synthesis (VL-SIPS),that combines photolithographic
	technologies adapted fromthe semiconductor industry with combinatorial
	chemistry. Commerciallyavailable DNA chips contain more than a half
	millionprobes and are expected to exceed one hundred million probes
	inthe next generation. This paper is one of the first attempts to
	applyVLSI CAD methods to the problem of probe placement in DNAchips,
	where the main objective is to minimize total border cost(i.e.,
	the number of nucleotide mismatches between adjacent sites).We make
	the following contributions. First, we propose severalpartitioning-based
	algorithms for DNA probe placement thatimprove solution quality
	by over 4% compared to best previouslyknown methods. Second, we
	give a simple in-place probe re-embeddingalgorithm with solution
	quality better than previous"chessboard" and batched greedy algorithms.
	Third, we experimentallyevaluate scalability and suboptimality of
	existing and newlyproposed probe placement algorithms. Interestingly,
	we find thatDNA placement algorithms appear to have better suboptimalityproperties
	than those recently reported for VLSI placement algorithms.},

  abstract = {DNA microarrays are powerful tools for quantifying gene expression
	patterns. However, obtaining reliable estimates of gene expression
	from raw measurements on microarrays presents several problems due
	to background contributions, nonspecific probe response, possible
	variation in probe sensitivities, and possible nonlinear responses
	of the probes to transcript concentration. In an effort to address
	the nonspecific response of probes, Affymetrix GeneChip arrays use
	two probes for each measurement. One of these probes, the mismatch
	(MM) probe, is intended to reflect the nonspecific response of the
	corresponding perfect match (PM) probe. However, the reliability
	of this approach has not been established by published experiments.
	Indeed, some research has shown that at high transcript concentrations,
	the nonspecific component of the PM signal is a negligible part
	of the MM signal. Five variations of a method to model and estimate
	levels of gene expression on Affymetrix chips, without the use of
	MM cells, are presented. To test the validity of the algorithms,
	six different concentrations of human liver cRNA were prepared.
	Each of these solutions was then hybridized on five Affymetrix hg95A
	arrays using five different scanners. The expression estimates obtained
	using each of the five algorithms bore a strong linear relationship
	to the cRNA concentrations, particularly at low cRNA concentrations.
	The five variations were applied to a Latin square data set and
	the results compared with those obtained using Affymetrix MAS 5.0
	and using robust multichip analysis. R2 values obtained using the
	new techniques were comparable, while fold changes were superior.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: High density DNA oligo microarrays are widely used in
	biomedical research. Selection of optimal DNA oligos that are deposited
	on the microarrays is critical. Based on sequence information and
	hybridization free energy, we developed a new algorithm to select
	optimal short (20-25 bases) or long (50 or 70 bases) oligos from
	genes or open reading frames (ORFs) and predict their hybridization
	behavior. Having optimized probes for each gene is valuable for
	two reasons. By minimizing background hybridization they provide
	more accurate determinations of true expression levels. Having optimum
	probes minimizes the number of probes needed per gene, thereby decreasing
	the cost of each microarray, raising the number of genes on each
	chip and increasing its usage. RESULTS: In this paper we describe
	algorithms to optimize the selection of specific probes for each
	gene in an entire genome. The criteria for truly optimum probes
	are easily stated but they are not computable at all levels currently.
	We have developed an heuristic approach that is efficiently computable
	at all levels and should provide a good approximation to the true
	optimum set. We have run the program on the complete genomes for
	several model organisms and deposited the results in a database
	that is available on-line (http://ural.wustl.edu/~lif/probe.pl).

	short oligonucleotide array data will give different results},
  journal = {BMC Bioinformatics},
  year = {2006},
  volume = {7},
  pages = {137},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Short oligonucleotide arrays for transcript profiling
	have been available for several years. Generally, raw data from
	these arrays are analysed with the aid of the Microarray Analysis
	Suite or GeneChip Operating Software (MAS or GCOS) from Affymetrix.
	Recently, more methods to analyse the raw data have become available.
	Ideally all these methods should come up with more or less the same
	results. We set out to evaluate the different methods and include
	work on our own data set, in order to test which method gives the
	most reliable results. RESULTS: Calculating gene expression with
	6 different algorithms (MAS5, dChip PMMM, dChip PM, RMA, GC-RMA
	and PDNN) using the same (Arabidopsis) data, results in different
	calculated gene expression levels. Consequently, depending on the
	method used, different genes will be identified as differentially
	regulated. Surprisingly, there was only 27 to 36\% overlap between
	the different methods. Furthermore, 47.5\% of the genes/probe sets
	showed good correlation between the mismatch and perfect match intensities.
	CONCLUSION: After comparing six algorithms, RMA gave the most reproducible
	results and showed the highest correlation coefficients with Real
	Time RT-PCR data on genes identified as differentially expressed
	by all methods. However, we were not able to verify, by Real Time
	RT-PCR, the microarray results for most genes that were solely calculated
	by RMA. Furthermore, we conclude that subtraction of the mismatch
	intensity from the perfect match intensity results most likely in
	a significant underestimation for at least 47.5\% of the expression
	values. Not one algorithm produced significant expression values
	for genes present in quantities below 1 pmol. If the only purpose
	of the microarray experiment is to find new candidate genes, and
	too many genes are found, then mutual exclusion of the genes predicted
	by contrasting methods can be used to narrow down the list of new
	candidate genes by 64 to 73\%.},

  abstract = {An efficient method was developed for making complete sets of oligonucleotides
	of defined length, covalently attached to the surface of a glass
	plate, by synthesizing them in situ. A device carrying all octapurine
	sequences was used to explore factors affecting molecular hybridization
	of the tethered oligonucleotides, to develop computer-aided methods
	for analyzing the data, and to test the feasibility of using the
	method for sequence analysis. Further development is needed before
	the method can be used routinely, but our work shows that it has
	a number of potential advantages over gel-based methods: it should
	be easy to automate; the quality of the sequence results can be
	evaluated statistically; it provides a powerful way of comparing
	related sequences and detecting mutation; it can be applied to both
	DNA and RNA; and specific motifs can be incorporated into all sequences
	of the array to focus analysis on sequences of biological interest.},

  abstract = {The oligo microarray (DNA chip) technology in recent years has a significant
	impact on genomic study. Many fields such as gene discovery, drug
	discovery, toxicological research and disease diagnosis, will certainly
	benefit from its use. A microarray is an orderly arrangement of
	thousands of DNA fragments where each DNA fragment is a probe (or
	a fingerprint) of a gene/cDNA. It is important that each probe must
	uniquely associate with a particular gene/cDNA. Otherwise, the performance
	of the microarray will be affected. Existing algorithms usually
	select probes using the criteria of homogeneity, sensitivity, and
	specificity. Moreover, they improve efficiency employing some heuristics.
	Such approaches reduce the accuracy. Instead, we make use of some
	smart filtering techniques to avoid redundant computation while
	maintaining the accuracy. Based on the new algorithm, optimal short
	(20 bases) or long (50 or 70 bases) probes can be computed efficiently
	for large genomes.},

	expression for whole genomes. These arrays can be synthesized by
	adapting photolithographic techniques used in microelectronics.
	Using this method, oligonucleotides are built base by base directly
	on the array surface by numerous cycles of photodeprotection and
	nucleotide addition. In this paper we examine strategies to reduce
	the number of synthesis cycles required to construct oligonucleotide
	arrays. By computer modeling oligonucleotide synthesis, we found
	that the number of required synthesis cycles could be significantly
	reduced by focusing upon how oligonucleotides are chosen from within
	genes and upon the order in which nucleotides are deposited on the
	array. The methods described here could provide a more efficient
	strategy to produce oligonucleotide arrays.},
